I have been working as a developer since 2019, when I started a project in my college where I did learn Python and Django. In 2020 I found a free onsite course about Vue.js that was sponsored by a company called Conta Azul and I did it.

<br/>

After doing that course I decided focusing on Django and Vue.js, so I read their documentation a lot and saw many videos and did many courses to improve my knowledge. In the mean time I had worked on SAAS (Software as a Service) projects at work and also on side projects using these and others stacks.

<br/>

Since then I'm a full-stack developer and I have been learning more and more about software development, good practices and trying to be a complete professional (W professional). Currently I'm doing an extensive course about full cycle development, where now I'm learning about DevOps process and tools, and after completing this module I will learn more about architecture and development using all that I learned.
