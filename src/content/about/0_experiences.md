I have been working as a developer since 2019, when I became a scholarship developer and I started working on a project of an event management system. This project gave me the opportunity to get experience with development using Python and Django, and also HTML, CSS, Javascript and Postgres database.

<br/>

In 2020, I was invited to work on another project of a student management system. On this project I did everything about the backend by myself, from the ER model, REST API development with unit and integration testes, CI/CD pipeline, to the project documentation.

<br/>

After that, in 2021, I was recommended by my teacher to work as a software engineer on a project of a logistic company. I did put in practice all the knowledge I got since then. The project was a rewrite of a legacy system using modern technologies and techniques, and for that, I started talking to the users to understand how did it works and also to collect feedbacks for improvements on the new version. During the development we did meetings to align and plan features to delivery, as we made use of Extreme Programming for an efficient delivery, and in these meetings I actively participated bringing back users pains to fix those issues.

<br/>

Just over a year later, in 2022, I joined on a credit analysis startup as also a software engineer. I got the opportunity to work on the credit policies automation for big clients as Tigre, Metalnox, Electrolux, Cantu and Marest. I contributed helping a lot on standardization and improvements for the development process to get more efficient deliveries with the good utilization of SCRUM, BDD, ubiquitous language, pair programming, CI/CD pipeline and documentation.

Currently on AMcom since november 2023, I'm always seeking to grow, achieving knowledge and seeking great results. #LifelongLearning üìö
