I have been working as a developer since 2019, when I became a scholarship developer and I started working on a project of a event management system for the federal institutions from Brazil. This project gave me the opportunity to get experience with development using Python and Django, and also HTML, CSS, Javascript and Postgres database.

<br/>

Next year, in 2020, I was invited to work on a new project of a student management system for the federal institutions from Brazil again. On this project I was able to decide everything about the backend, from the ER model, REST API development with unit and integration testes, CI/CD pipeline, to the project documentation.

After the end of the contract, in 2021, I was recommended by my teacher to work as a software engineer on a project of a logistic company. I did put in practice all the knowledge I got since then. The project was a rewrite of a legacy system using modern technologies and techniques, and for that, I decided to talk to the users to understand how did it works and also to collect feedbacks of possible improvements for the new version. During the development we did meetings to align and plan the next features to delivery, as we made use of Extreme Programming for a efficient delivery, and in these meetings I actively participated as I knew the users pains.

<br/>

One year later, in 2022, I joined on a startup of credit analysis and there I was also a software engineer. I got the opportunity to work on the credit policies automation of big clients as Tigre, Metalnox, Electrolux, Cantu, Marest and others. I contributed with better standardization and improvements for the development process to get more efficient deliveries with the good utilization of SCRUM, BDD, ubiquitous language, pair programming, CI/CD pipeline and documentation.

Since november 2023, currently on AMcom, I'm always seeking to grow, achieving knowledge and seeking great results. #LifelongLearning üìö
