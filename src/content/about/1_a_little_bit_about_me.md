In my spare time I usually like to watch some movie, and my favorite kinds are bad comedy, action, thriller, slasher, escape room movies and sci-fi. Also, I like to spare a lot of time watching mystery series or action anime like Demon Slayer and Jujutsu Kaisen.

I really appreciate going out to try new foods on different restaurants or going to the theater. I'm a very good critic. Feel free to ask recommendations 😁.

Also, sometimes I play games on my computer or board games with friends, and when I want to go messy I go out with friends to parties 🕺.
